# The MC HCK!

The goal is to have a small, cheap, and powerful development board
that supports USB for easy programming, at low parts costs (current
estimate: $5). This allows us to use the board for all silly purposes
where spending >$20 for an Arduino is just too much. The board is like
the [Teensy](http://pjrc.com/teensy/index.html), just with an ARM
microcontroller instead.
